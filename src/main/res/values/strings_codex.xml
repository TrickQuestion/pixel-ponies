            <name>A Brief History of the Wagon Harness</name>
            <scarcity>common</scarcity>
            <desc>This paperback book doesn\'t seem very interesting by its title, but it does
                contain some useful information about the merits of honesty.
                \n\n
                \"Honesty is a necessary virtue for the proper use of any kind of harness or barding.
                If a pony isn\'t honest enough, they won\'t be able to bear its weight. This causes
                the pony to suffer an encumbrance penalty, and the larger the discrepancy, the
                greater the penalty. Encumbered ponies move more slowly and are less capable of
                defending themselves. If a flying pony is encumbered, the penalty is even more
                obvious because they also lose their natural ability to fly quickly. Additionally,
                flying ponies cannot gain altitude while encumbered, even when the encumbrance is
                small.\"
                \n\n
                \"Whether bucking trees or punching monsters, honesty determines how much damage a
                pony can deal. If a pony is wielding horseshoes or another hoof-to-hoof weapon, they
                must have sufficient honesty for the weapon or they will attack more slowly, hit
                less frequently, and do less damage. On the other hoof, if a pony has more honesty
                than a hoof-to-hoof weapon requires, they will deal additional damage with it. As
                before, the degree of penalty or bonus depends on the size of the discrepancy.\"
                \n\n
                \"It should be noted that honesty requirements do not apply to bow or cannon use.
                They do apply to throwing weapons, but having excess honesty for a thrown weapon
                will not confer any bonus to damage. Although there are old legends of tiger-striped
                equines possessing the ability to throw weapons more forcefully with honesty, this
                is not a book in ancient mythology so we shall not elaborate further.\"

            <name>Bygone Griffins of Greatness</name>
            <scarcity>common</scarcity>
            <desc>This paperback history guide reads more like a tourist brochure. Nonetheless, even
                though it wasn\'t written by ponies, it contains a lot of practical information on
                the virtue of loyalty.
                \n\n
                \"The practical benefits to the virtue of loyalty are rather surprising, and form a
                keystone of the military wing of our kingdom. Anybirdy who is unencumbered by armor
                too heavy for their honesty will find that their flight speed increases in accord
                with their loyalty virture. Indeed, even running speed is faster for loyal griffons.
                This is one reason traitors rarely escape the nesting grounds.\"
                \n\n
                \"Loyalty also plays an important role in accuracy with weapons. This applies to all
                kinds of weapons: claw-to-claw, thrown, or the aim of a bow or cannon. The higher
                one\'s loyalty, the more precise the aim becomes.\"
                \n\n
                \"Even beyond this benefit, proper use of a missile weapon such as a bow or cannon
                will require a minimum loyalty based on the difficulty of using the weapons. More
                powerful weapons require greater loyalty. If a bird lacks the loyalty needed to
                wield a bow or cannon, they will miss more frequently and it will take them longer
                to fire the weapon. The larger the discrepancy between the bird\'s loyalty and the
                weapon\'s minimum requirement, the more severe these penalties are.\"
                \n\n
                \"There is no special benefit to having excess loyalty for a weapon\'s requirements,
                however due to the everpresent accuracy benefit loyalty applies to all weapons,
                the most loyal soldiers and crew are generally the most valuable regardless as to
                whether the weapons in employ are primitive slings or monster cloud-turrets.\"

            <scarcity>common</scarcity>
            <desc>This silly-looking paperback manual describes how to have fun at sleepovers.
                While that might not seem particularly useful in your present situation, it also
                contains useful information about the virtue of laughter.
                \n\n
                \"The number one think you\'re supposed to do at a sleepover is have fun! Laughter is
                an extremely important virtue for ponies of all ages, for a number of reasons.\"
                \n\n
                \"First of all, humor keeps you in good shape by quickening your wit and reflexes.
                Ponies who laugh regularly lead more active lives. They can get more done in the
                same space of time, whether it\'s running, eating, working, playing, or even resting!
                There is a small down-side, of course: by being so active, they get hungry quicker
                too! But a larger appetite is a small price to pay for having so much energy.
                Fortunately, if you\'re super-duper funny (or if you find another way to speed
                yourself up considerably), eventually you\'ll end up doing more things for less food
                overall.\"
                \n\n
                \"There\'s a reason for the expression \'happy-go-lucky\': when you laugh, things
                just seem to go your way more often! This comes up in all sorts of different areas,
                whether it\'s finding just the thing you need or other sorts of \'random\'
                situations, fortune will smile upon you.\"
                \n\n
                \"And finally, the rumor is true: laughter is the best medicine! Not only will
                laughter help good things happen to you, it protects you from bad things and makes
                them go away more quickly.\"
