                This paperback book doesn\'t seem very interesting by its title, but it does
                contain some useful information about the merits of honesty.
                \n\n
                \"Honesty is a necessary virtue for the proper use of any kind of harness or barding.
                If a pony isn\'t honest enough, they won\'t be able to bear its weight. This causes
                the pony to suffer an encumbrance penalty, and the larger the discrepancy, the
                greater the penalty. Encumbered ponies move more slowly and are less capable of
                defending themselves. If a flying pony is encumbered, the penalty is even more
                obvious because they also lose their natural ability to fly quickly. Additionally,
                flying ponies cannot gain altitude while encumbered, even when the encumbrance is
                small.\"
                \n\n
                \"Whether bucking trees or punching monsters, honesty determines how much damage a
                pony can deal. If a pony is wielding horseshoes or another hoof-to-hoof weapon, they
                must have sufficient honesty for the weapon or they will attack more slowly, hit
                less frequently, and do less damage. On the other hoof, if a pony has more honesty
                than a hoof-to-hoof weapon requires, they will deal additional damage with it. As
                before, the degree of penalty or bonus depends on the size of the discrepancy.\"
                \n\n
                \"It should be noted that honesty requirements do not apply to bow or cannon use.
                They do apply to throwing weapons, but having excess honesty for a thrown weapon
                will not confer any bonus to damage. Although there are old legends of tiger-striped
                equines possessing the ability to throw weapons more forcefully with honesty, this
                is not a book in ancient mythology so we shall not elaborate further.\"

                This paperback history guide reads more like a tourist brochure. Nonetheless, even
                though it wasn\'t written by ponies, it contains a lot of practical information on
                the virtue of loyalty.
                \n\n
                \"The practical benefits to the virtue of loyalty are rather surprising, and form a
                keystone of the military wing of our kingdom. Anybirdy who is unencumbered by armor
                too heavy for their honesty will find that their flight speed increases in accord
                with their loyalty virture. Indeed, even running speed is faster for loyal griffons.
                This is one reason traitors rarely escape the nesting grounds.\"
                \n\n
                \"Loyalty also plays an important role in accuracy with weapons. This applies to all
                kinds of weapons: claw-to-claw, thrown, or the aim of a bow or cannon. The higher
                one\'s loyalty, the more precise the aim becomes.\"
                \n\n
                \"Even beyond this benefit, proper use of a missile weapon such as a bow or cannon
                will require a minimum loyalty based on the difficulty of using the weapons. More
                powerful weapons require greater loyalty. If a bird lacks the loyalty needed to
                wield a bow or cannon, they will miss more frequently and it will take them longer
                to fire the weapon. The larger the discrepancy between the bird\'s loyalty and the
                weapon\'s minimum requirement, the more severe these penalties are.\"
                \n\n
                \"There is no special benefit to having excess loyalty for a weapon\'s requirements,
                however due to the everpresent accuracy benefit loyalty offers to all weapons,
                the most loyal soldiers and crew are generally the most valuable regardless as to
                whether the weapons in employ are primitive slings or monster cloud-turrets.\"

                This silly-looking manual describes how to have fun at sleepovers.
                While that might not seem particularly useful in your present situation, it also
                contains useful information about the virtue of laughter.
                \n\n
                \"The number one thing you\'re supposed to do at a sleepover is have fun! Laughter is
                an extremely important virtue for ponies of all ages, for a number of reasons.\"
                \n\n
                \"First of all, humor keeps you in good shape by quickening your wit and reflexes.
                Ponies who laugh regularly lead more active lives. They can get more done in the
                same space of time, whether it\'s running, eating, working, playing, or even resting!
                There is a small down-side, of course: by being so active, they get hungry quicker
                too! But a larger appetite is a small price to pay for having so much energy.
                Fortunately, if you\'re super-duper funny (or if you find another way to speed
                yourself up considerably), eventually you\'ll end up doing more things for less food
                overall.\"
                \n\n
                \"There\'s a reason for the expression \'happy-go-lucky\': when you laugh, things
                just seem to go your way more often! This comes up in all sorts of different areas.
                Whether it\'s finding just the thing you need or handling other kinds of \'random\'
                situations, fortune will smile upon the stout of heart.\"
                \n\n
                \"And finally, the rumor is true: laughter is the best medicine! Not only will
                laughter help good things happen to you, it will protect you from bad things and make
                misery go away more quickly.\"

                What looks at first like a guide on obscure magic spells is actually a manual on
                how to maximize the virtue of generosity through surreptitious giving. One passage
                in particular catches your eye:\n\n
                \"Fortunately, generosity is its own reward. Being generous gives one a discerning
                eye which can aid during a giving spree. Generosity is the largest contributor to
                one\'s powers of observation. While it won\'t make it any easier to see things from
                a distance, it will at least increase the odds you\'ll notice something important
                before accidentally stepping on it.\"\n\n
                \"In addition to general observation powers, generosity also helps you identify the
                quality of equipment you\'re holding. The highly generous can discern the quality of
                their wielded items (be they weapons, barding, or accessories) in no time at
                all.\"\n\n
                \"And if that weren\'t enough, generosity also improves a body\'s natural ability
                to heal. The more generous you are, the faster your health will recover from injury.
                Sadly, this doesn\'t apply to illnesses or poison: for those, you\'ll need laughter
                or magic, respectively.\"

                You don\'t think a children\'s fairy tale would be of much use to you, but as luck
                would have it, this particular story is all about practical applications of the
                virtue of kindness.\n\n
                \"Kindness is a difficult virtue to express when you\'re being surrounded by scary
                monsters that want to gobble you up, but this is when it\'s most important! There
                are several essential benefits to the virtue of kindness that everypony should know
                about.\"\n\n
                \"First, kindness makes it easier to avoid detection. The more altruistic you are,
                the more you\'ll seem to fade into the background. This isn\'t always a good thing,
                but in dangerous situations it can come in very useful.\"\n\n
                \"Second, kindness makes it harder for scary things to hit you! This is probably
                the most important benefit of kindness, and it\'s the one you\'re likely to notice
                the most. Nothing protects you from attack better than the virtue of kindness.\"\n\n
                \"Finally, if you\'re especially kind, you can get discounts on the goods and
                services you haggle for. However, be forewarned: this won\'t work if you\'re an
                incurable pushover (whimper-squeak).\"

                It\'s a dime-store magazine about spellcasting, filled with an unusual amount of
                information on the virtue of magic.\n\n
                \"Even if you\'re not a mage, the virtue of magic is one you shouldn\'t shirk from.
                Magic plays a central role in pony technology, and even if you\'re a humble earth
                pony who eschews direct manipulation of mana, knowing a trick or two could one day
                save your life!\"\n\n
                \"Magic is a prerequisite for the use of some magic items, but not others. Magic
                scrolls are safe to cast by anypony, but use of magic wands requires a minimum level
                of magic competence. If you lack the magical competence for a wand, every time you
                fire the wand there\'s a chance something will go very wrong. The required magic can
                be reduced by upgrading the wand.\"\n\n
                \"Magic rings and accessories have similar requirements. If you wield a magical
                accessory on your mane or tail, you must meet the minimum magic requirement of the
                accessory. Failure to do this means the accessory will occasionally \'backfire\'
                and do something bad to you. The larger the discrepancy, the more frequently you\'ll
                suffer the consequences. This is especially annoying if the accessory itself is
                cursed, in which case you can be affected negatively in two ways!\"\n\n
                \"In some cases, having a strong connection to magic will cause certain magic
                effects to be more powerful, such as a casting of Psionic Blast. In other cases, it
                will protect you from negative consequences: you\'re less likely to cause magic
                cancellations when upgrading an imbued weapon or enchanted armor, for example.\"\n\n
                \"One last area of importance: magic is the only virtue that can help you to resist
                health-based damage that ignores all armor, such as damage from poison, deadly gas,
                or electricity. These forms of injury are frequently deadly, so magic\'s role in
                mitigating disaster cannot be overstated.\"

                It\'s well and good that an adventurer knows their survival depends upon the virtues
                of honesty, loyalty, laughter, generosity, kindness, and magic. But how can a hero
                embark upon a quest for self-improvement while adventuring at the same time?\n\n
                Honesty, loyalty, and magic are easy enough to improve: potions of honesty, scrolls
                of loyalty, and books of magic require no special ability to use. However, like all
                virtue-raising devices, they are limited in number and must be actively sought.\n\n
                Generosity is a stat best gained by assisting others, so be on the lookout for
                quests and opportunities to donate your time and resources.\n\n
                Kindness is similar in many ways. Offering your assistance may be all that is
                required to gain in kindness, but kindness is the one stat that you must preserve
                in order to improve. Attacking fleeing monsters or monsters who can\'t reach
                you isn\'t very sporting.\n\n
                Finally, who can say about laughter? There are plenty of different ways to improve
                your sense of humor, most of which make no sense at all. You might need to find a
                more specialized guide on the subject.
