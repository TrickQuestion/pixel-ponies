    <!-- STRINGS OF HeroSubClass CLASS -->

    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameFarmer">farmer</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescFarmer">The _Farmer_ can gather dewdrops and seeds from special plants, and can go longer without food.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameBard">bard</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescBard">The _Bard_ uses Laughter to recover more quickly from negative effects. This won\'t help with effects that cause damage, like being on fire. (Fix this--doesn\'t laughter already do that?)</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameRoyalGuard">royal guard</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescRoyalGuard">A successful attack with a melee weapon allows the _Royal Guard_ to start a combo, in which every additional hit inflicts bonus damage.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameMagician">magician</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescMagician">The _Magician_ can use her horn to cast Mana Bolts and Teleportation, in addition to Telekinesis (which is painful). Tapping monsters will automatically cast Mana Bolts unless a Bow is equipped.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameArtist">artist</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescArtist">The _Artist_ automatically detects cursed items, knows the ability of a ring upon wielding it, and can safely equip items with one fewer point of the necessary attribute.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NamePrincess">princess</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescPrincess">By wearing a ring on her horn, the _Princess_ can use it as a weapon while gaining the ring\'s usual buff. Different rings produce different magical attacks.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameScout">scout</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescScout">The _Scout_ gains a bonus to damage when blindsiding a monster.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameBeastmaster">beastmaster</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescBeastmaster">When the _Beastmaster_ attempts to hit an undamaged monster with a melee attack, there is a Kindness-based chance the monster will become a pet. This only works with animal monsters.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameThunderbolt">thunderbolt</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescThunderbost">After flying unencumbered for a short distance, the _Thunderbolt_ gains a bonus to all attributes. The bonus lasts until one turn after the flight ends. (Tweak this.)</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameShaman">shaman</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescShaman">The _Shaman_ can brew potions more reliably, and he suffers no negative effects from eating seeds.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameSeer">seer</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescSeer">The _Seer_ can sense cursed items (resolve this with Artist at some point). All basic potion and scroll types are known to him. He can detect changelings on sight, which allows him to strike first. (And bonus? Tweak.)</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameEnchanter">enchanter</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescEnchanter">Thrown weapon strikes from the _Enchanter_ have a Magic-based chance of inflicting a random negative status. Additionally, weapon and barding enchantments are chosen rather than randomly assigned. (The \'evil dances\' and \'pony stew\' rumors are somewhat exaggerated, however.)</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameNocturne">nocturne</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescNocturne">The _Nocturne_ berserks when her health is low. This temporarily lowers her Kindness, but she deals significantly more damage.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameAssassin">assassin</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescAssassin">The _Assassin_ has a Loyalty-based chance to completely bypass monster armor whenever she fires a Bow.</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_NameVampony">vampony</string>
    <string name="HeroSubClass_DescVampony">The _Vampony_ gains health and reduces hunger each time she defeats a monster. She also gains a boost to damage whenever she is hungry, but not starving. (Tweak to make cooler?)</string>
