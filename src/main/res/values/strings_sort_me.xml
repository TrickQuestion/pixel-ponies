    <string name="Dungeon_DeadEnd">What are you doing here?!</string>

    <string-array name="Dungeon_Tips">
        <item>If you don\'t have enough Honesty for a suit of barding, you\'ll be encumbered. Melee weapons also require Honesty for effective use. Scrolls of Upgrade can be used to improve a piece of equipment (or a wand), which also makes it easier to use.</item>
        <item>Traps and secret doors are detected with Generosity. If you can\'t find a way out, try searching. Generosity also helps you figure out unfamiliar equipment, and heal from damage over time.</item>
        <item>Loyalty improves your speed, and it allows you to use missile weapons effectively. Magic boosts the effect of magical items and it recharges your wands. You need to meet Magic requirements on wands and rings to use them safely.</item>
        <item>Kindness lets you sneak around monsters and helps you to dodge attacks. Laughter improves the mood of shopkeepers, increases the odds good things will happen to you, and helps bad things to go away more quickly.</item>
        <item>Beware the Smelly Ooze!</item>
        <item>Stores appear after you\'ve defeated a Boss. There\'s one adjacent to this room where you can purchase gear with your hard-earned Bits.</item>
        <item>Melee weapons do extra damage for Honesty above the required minimum. There\'s no bonus for other kinds of equipment, but they won\'t work well if you don\'t meet their minimum requirements.</item>
        <item>It helps to identify potions and scrolls early, but you need to be clever about how you go about it.</item>
        <item>If you\'re faster than a monster, you can blindside it by attacking the moment it pops into view.</item>
        <item>Turn back now, or face the Nightmare Eternal!</item>
        <item>Items which increase your attributes are limited in number. It\'s simple to raise Honesty, Loyalty, and Magic, but there are clever tricks to raising Laughter, Kindness, and Generosity.</item>
        <item>Use your horse sense when facing danger. For example, you can\'t put out fire in water if you\'re stuck levitating above it, and fire burns longer when it has fuel to burn.</item>
        <item>Ankhs aren\'t very useful unless you\'re actually planning to die, and you need to be a clever pony to plan for your own funeral. Your bits are usually better spent on other things.</item>
        <item>Welcome to the Changeling Hive. Donations of Love are freely accepted here. Also, non-donations.</item>
        <item>Once you reach a certain level, weaker monsters will stop giving you experience. Eventually, weak monsters will stop dropping items and bits. Level up strategically to maximize your earnings.</item>
        <item>It usually pays to be hungry, because hunger won\'t hurt you. Sometimes it\'s even a good idea to starve!</item>
        <item>Upgrading enchanted items may destroy the enchantment. Magic reduces the chance of enchantment failure.</item>
        <item>Even if you\'re not a Shaman, there are secrets to brewing potions.</item>
        <item>The Centaur of Power has escaped from Tartarus!</item>
        <item>Although Scrolls of Upgrade are rare, upgrading equipment is pretty simple. Enchanting weapons and barding is more complicated.</item>
        <item>In some cases the reward can be worth less than the quest item, although that\'s not particularly Generous.</item>
        <item>There are certain items that can only be obtained through a Well of Transmutation.</item>
        <item>The Crystal King hungers from the shadows...</item>
        <item>What you can\'t see can still hurt you. The other way around, well... not so much.</item>
        <item>Barding created with the Crystalling kit will include a special ability. The price to use the ability is steep, but the results can be worth it.</item>
        <item>There are actually three classes for each pony race, not two!</item>
        <item>(The text is entirely illegible.)</item>

    <!-- STRINGS OF WndStory CLASS -->
    <string name="WndStory_Sewers">The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City\'s sewer system. Being nominally a part of the City, these levels are not that dangerous. No one will call it a safe place, but at least you won\'t need to deal with much evil magic here.</string>
    <string name="WndStory_Prision">Many years ago an underground prison was built here for the most dangerous criminals. At the time it seemed like a very clever idea, because this place indeed was very hard to escape. But soon dark miasma started to permeate from below, driving prisoners and guards insane. In the end the prison was abandoned, though some convicts were left locked up here.</string>
    <string name="WndStory_Caves">The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparsely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of the Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.</string>
    <string name="WndStory_Metropolis">The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves had successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors had brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.</string>
    <string name="WndStory_Halls">In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it\'s called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...</string>
    <string name="WndStory_Spiders">Many, many years ago there was a rich mine, full of magical stone. But once mineral veins dried up the miners moved out, leaving behind wide network of tunnels. Eventually this place was populated by spiders. But even these dangerous creatures, lurking in the dark, wasn\'t enough to scare away the brave and insane ones longing for treasures that might be found in the mines. For the scale of danger is always proportional to the amount of rumours telling about magical artefacts. Once upon a time an evil witch wondered into the tunnels trying to escape from prosecutors. But superstitious people wouldn\'t dare to step into the darkness. So they decided to wait. But she never showed up. Maybe witch has found another way out, maybe she managed to slip by the guards... or she perished, surrounded by rustle of the creatures of the dark.</string>
